LINQ to Twitter is an open source 3rd party LINQ Provider (Twitter Library) for the [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) micro-blogging service.  It uses standard LINQ syntax for queries and includes method calls for changes via the [Twitter API](https://dev.twitter.com/).

## Example

The following query returns search results where people are tweeting about LINQ providers:
```C#
var twitterCtx = new TwitterContext(...);

TwitterSearch? searchResponse =
    await
    (from search in twitterCtx.TwitterSearch
     where search.Type == SearchType.RecentSearch &&
           search.Query == "LINQ to"
     select search)
    .SingleOrDefaultAsync();

if (searchResponse?.Tweets != null)
    searchResponse.Tweets.ForEach(tweet =>
        Console.WriteLine(
            $"\nID: {tweet.ID}" +
            $"\nTweet: {tweet.Text}"));
```
From a coding experience perspective, the `TwitterContext` type is analogous to the Entity Framework `DBContext`.  You use the `TwitterContext` instance, `twitterCtx`, to access `IQueryable<T>` tweet categories.  In the example above, the `TwitterSearch` will give you the ability to search Twitter for tweets meeting some criteria.

> *Note:* The ellipses in the TwitterContext parameters indicates that you need to provide an authorizer with credentials, which is required. You can visit [Securing Your Applications](https://github.com/JoeMayo/LinqToTwitter/wiki/Securing-Your-Applications) for documentation on authorizers and visit the Download page for working examples.

Each query category has a `Type` property for the type of tweets you want to get back.  For example, `Tweet` queries can be made for `Mentions`, `ReverseChronological`, or `Tweets` timelines. Each query category also has an `XxxType` enum to help you figure out what is available. The example above uses `SearchType.RecentSearch` to perform searches on matching tweets that happened within the last two weeks or so.  Another example would be `Like` queries which might have `LikeType.Lookup` as its `Type` to get all the users who liked a tweet.  The `Type` idiom is consistent across all query categories.

Just like other LINQ providers, you get an `IQueryable<T>` back from the query.  You can see how to materialize the query by invoking the `SingleOrDefaultAsync` operator.  For `TwitterSearch` results, you receive one `TwitterSearch` entity that contains metadata about the `Search` query and also contains a `Tweets` property that is a collection of `Tweet` entities. Just like other LINQ providers, LINQ to Twitter does deferred execution, so operators such as `ToListAsync` and `SingleOrDefaultAsync` or statements such as `for` and `foreach` loops will cause the query to execute and make the actual call to Twitter.

LINQ to Twitter is asynchronous. You can see this where the code above `await's` the query, using the `SingleOrDefaultAsync` operator. Commands are async also. e.g. `await TweetAsync("Hello from LINQ to Twitter")`.

For more details on how LINQ to Twitter works, you can visit [LINQ to Twitter v6 APIs](https://www.linqtotwitter.com/LINQ-to-Twitter-v6.html) for API specific examples. The downloadable source code also contains copious examples in the projects. Just look in the _Samples_ folder.

## NuGet
In addition to being able to download from this site, you can also automatically install LINQ to Twitter into your projects via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/linqtotwitter);
